## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model to classify customers as "likely to churn" or "not likely to churn" based on historical data. This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Insights and recommendations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis
  - matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization
  - scikit-learn: Machine learning model development
